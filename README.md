## Overview

Rec Trails is an offline-first mobile application for Android and IOS purposed for displaying local government open data centered around outdoor recreation.
This open-source project aims to provide local government agencies and municipal tourism teams the ability to stand up their own customized outdoor recreation application that leverages their own data that is 100% offline and free.

## Why Rec Trails

- **Specific Trail and POI Information:** There are a long list of outdoor recreation apps on the market. But there are very few that have the detailed GIS information that your municipality has. Rec Trails allows for attaching additional trail information (e.g. paved vs dirt, dogs allowed, wheelchair accessable, etc.) as well as useful point of interest
  info, such as outhouse vs running water bathroom, bench locations, lookout points, covered picnic shelter, or any other info that helps users better navigate your municipality's outdoor recreation. 
  
- **No pre-downloading of data:** No pre-downloading and caching of data. All data (vector and raster) is embedded in the application, with no REST calls to a cloud server.
  
- **No monthly subscriptions:** With what is currently on the market for trails and outdoor rec geospatial information, you are often at the whim of what is classified as free, and what is premium. Rec Trails gives the ability for municipalities to remove this cost barrier for tourists and citizens.
  
- **Ease of Use:** If I struggle to set up other trail apps, so are parents and grandparents. Rec Trails is designed with UX being a top priority for users of any technical skill level.
  
-  **Customization:** Customization to your municipality branding, theme, font style, and overall marketing strategy. All branding can be quickly modified in a single config file without modifying the apps core platform.
